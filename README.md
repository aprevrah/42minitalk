# Minitalk

Minitalk is a project from the 42 coding schools

## Notes

You can read about the project in the **[subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/111166/en.subject.pdf)**.\
This one of my earlier implementations. I was forced to alter it slightly because of the rules at the coding school. For instance you are only supposed to have one global var and making it a struct is apparently cheating. XD
